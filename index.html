				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<img id= "tjk" src= "assets/images/TJK.jpg" alt= "Picture of the fabulously handsome Timothy J. King.">
				
				<p>I am Tim, a former educator, and aspiring web developer and bear wrestler. I am inspired by both professions, but since web development is slightly less risky, I am comfortable sticking with that for the time being. I am a recent graduate of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, Java script, React, MySQL, and many more. In addition to coding languages, I learned all necessary aspects of computer science which have helped me transform into the world class developer, about whom you are currently reading. <br> <br>
				In my spare time i enjoy completing projects for local non-profits as well as and volunteering for Special Olympics. As I continue to grow as a developer, I hope to assist non-profit organizations better reach their consumer-base, and build dynamic tools to improve efficiency.  </p>
